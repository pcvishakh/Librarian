Librarian
=========

Librarian is a desktop application to manage extensive collection of ebooks effectively. It is built on the concept of flexibilty and stability. It is able to handle large amount of ebooks with maximum efficience. I have tried my maximum to keep the functions minimum so as to improve the efficency of the core engine that drives the application. Librarian is built on the concept of modules. Each functionality is integrated as part of modules and works as part of the main module. The core module itself called the librarian handles the communication between various system like filesystem, database and network. The functionality is simple. The file manager when feed with a path will scan for files in the folder with the qualified extension and collection information related to it. Information is divided into two forms one if the physcial and other is virtual information. The physical information which is fixed ie. it includes the name of the file, the file size, the hash value, and format specific information. Format specific information is possible if format header reader is available. The vitrual information varies from entities to entities. An entity defines a form of information. Like it could be a ebook, an article or a thesis. Each has seperate set of virtual information. All the information or rather properties is saved in the backend. The backend to librarian could be any form of relational database.
